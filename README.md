This is the final project for SDEV220-51P-IO-202420-I-82X
This is a desk application that allows  a user interested in Classes offered by SANS (SANS.ORG) to select a skill path in Cybersecurity and a role in that skill path. 
The application will output a description of that cyber security skill path, and a description of that role within that skill path, but also and more importantly
the list of classes that offered by SANS, that the user can take to qualify for that skill/role in cybersecurity.
